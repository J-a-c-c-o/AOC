```
The structure includes:

- **Input.txt**: Puzzle input for the day.
- **Example.txt**: Example input for the day.
- **Main.java**: Java implementation of the solution.

The `utils` folder contains utility classes that simplify common tasks during Advent of Code:

### 🔧 Utility Classes:
- **`Graph.java`**: Implements graph data structures and algorithms like BFS/DFS.
- **`Edge.java`**: Represents edges in graph-based problems.
- **`Node.java`**: Represents nodes in graph-based problems.
- **`Grid.java`**: Provides helper methods to navigate and manipulate 2D grids.
- **`Point.java`**: Represents coordinates or positions in a grid.
- **`Pair.java`**: Represents a pair of elements.
- **`Triple.java`**: Represents a triple of elements.
- **`Quad.java`**: Represents a quadruple of elements.
- **`FrequencySet.java`**: A set that keeps track of the frequency of elements.
- **`FrequencySetLong.java`**: A set that keeps track of the frequency of elements (long version).
- **`Option.java`**: Represents an optional value.
- **`Utils.java`**: A helper class to streamline creating new challenge days by setting up files and directories.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
To run and build this project, you'll need the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 22 or higher**
- **Maven**: A build automation and dependency management tool.

### </> Clone the Repository
Clone this repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/J-a-c-c-o/Advent-of-Code.git
   cd Advent-of-Code
   ```

### 🛠️ Build the Project
Use Maven to build the project and resolve dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```


### 🌐 Token Configuration
The session token is essential to fetch your personalized puzzle input. Here’s how to set it up:

1. Log in to your Advent of Code account.
2. Open the browser’s developer tools (F12 or right-click and select Inspect).
3. Go to the Application tab.
4. Under Storage, find the Cookies section.
5. Copy the value of the `session` cookie.
6. Save the value in a file named `token.txt` in the `src/main/resources` directory.

Keep your session token **secret** and **never share** it publicly!


### 🌟 Create a New Day

To automate the process of creating a new day, you can use `Main.java` to generate the necessary files and directories.

### Steps:
1. **Ensure your token is available**:
    follow the instructions in the **[Token Configuration](#-Token-Configuration)** section to set up your session token.


2. **Run the `Main.java` class**:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java
    ```
   
   After running the class, you will be prompted to select which mode you want to run:
   Select `create` to create a new day.

    - It will:
        - Create a new directory for the day under the relevant year.
        - Fetch the input for the day's puzzle (if the token is valid).
        - Generate the necessary files, including `example.txt`, `input.txt`, and a `Main.java` template.



### Run a Solution
Run the solution using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

 You will be prompted to select which mode you want to run:
 Select `run` to run the solution for a specific day.
