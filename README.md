# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges in Java.

To create a new day, run `Util.java` with the day number and the year. \
This will create a new folder with the template files.

in the `utils` folder, there are some classes that might help.
- `Util.java` - creates a new day folder and has several methods to help with the challenges.
- `Pair.java` - a simple class to hold two values.
- `GraphNode.java` - a simple class to hold a node with children.
- `GraphSearch.java` - a class to help with graph search algorithms using `GraphNode.java`.
