# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges in Java.

To create a new day, run `Util.java` with the day number and the year. \
This will create a new folder with the template files.

in the `utils` folder, there are some classes that might help.
- `Util.java` - creates a new day folder and has several methods to help with the challenges.
- `Pair.java` - a simple class to hold two values.
- `Triple.java` - a simple class to hold three values.
- `Graph.java` - a simple graph class that hold several usefull functions such as Dijkstra.
- `Node.java` - a class that represents a node in the graph.
- `Edge.java` - a class that represents a edge in the graph. 
- `Point.java` - a class that holds 2 integers.
- `FrequencySet.java` - this class is a type of set that counts the amount of occurrences.
- `FrequencySetLong.java` - the same as `FrequencySet.java` but has a bigger max of items.
- `Option.java` - a class to propegate 2 different types in a return.
